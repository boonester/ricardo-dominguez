        <p>Ricardo Dominguez is an artist, activist, and professor at the University of California San Diego. He got his start blending art and activism with Critical Art Ensemble in the 1980s. With CAE, Ricardo would move to New York where he would become involved with the net art scene of the city, primarily with Wolfgang Staehle of thing.net. After becoming involved with the Zapatistas (EZLN) in 1994, Dominguez would be awakened to a new worldview of transparency and disturbance, which would lead him to leave CAE and start Electronic Disturbance Theater with artist Brett Stalbaum, political essayist Stefan Wray, and software engineer Carmin Karasic. After a long stint with EDT, Dominguez would start work with the UCSD for greater access to research infrastructure where he remains today.</p>
